##I’m planning on creating that a tool that will predict the 
quality of a leads and rank them. I have  pretty clean raw data 
from my company’s salesforce to serve as examples of “good quality” 
leads. I plan on scraping new data from craigslist and California, 
New York and liquor license databases.  This data will probably 
need a fair amount of finessing.
